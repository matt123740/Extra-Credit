Git is a very useful tool when programming and can make a programmers life a whole lot easier. Git uses a function called “logging” and that is useful when you change a program and want to see what is changed from the original copy. Logging in git allows you to be able to see a log each of yours or the other programmers edits the program. By git using this method, it could have helped me a lot when I was doing an assignment 6. 

The reason the logging function in git would have helped me in assignment 6 is because me and my fellow classmates would share with each other our pro’s and con’s in each of our programs. Sometimes, I would lose my program in the process of either sharing or changing the code and I would get very frustrated. Not having this logging function made assignment 6 go from being somewhat of a challenge to extremely difficult and annoying.If I had git, I would use it as a way of sharing my edit, but also using the log to show when any new revisions that had been made and where is was changed in the program.

In a real world situation, git would be a great tool to use. For example, in an internship or some large program that needs to be viewed and edited by multiple people, git would let you and multiple people be able to change and record every action done to the program, but not affecting the original piece unless the git author was to manually do it. This shows that git is a very useful tool for big companies and corporations that have a large programs that need bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
